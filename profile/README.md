**Your Group, Your Money, Your Future.**
CheMango DEFI is a decentralized finance application that empowers groups of friends, families, and communities to manage their money together. We provide a secure and transparent platform on the blockchain for collective savings and investment, without the need for traditional banks or financial intermediaries.

In addition to the information already provided, CheMango is focused on breaking into the Latin American market. The project aims to address the region's long-standing challenges with financial exclusion and low financial literacy.

## The Latin American Market Opportunity
Latin America is a high-growth market with a large, young, and digitally-native population. However, it also faces significant financial obstacles. 
Many people in the region lack access to traditional banking services, and there's a widespread need for improved financial education. CheMango is uniquely positioned to fill this gap.

- **Financial Inclusion**: We are targeting the **122 million** people in Latin America who remain unbanked, providing them with a secure and accessible platform to save and invest. Our decentralized 
model bypasses the need for traditional financial institutions.
- **Community-based Approach**: We believe that CheMango's focus on group savings and trust-based investing aligns perfectly with the strong communal and family values found throughout Latin America.
## The Perks of CheMango
**Trust-based Investing**: We transform the trust within your group into a powerful investment tool. With multisig wallets, every transaction requires the approval of multiple members, ensuring that all decisions are made collectively.

**Absolute Transparency**: All financial movements are recorded on the blockchain, providing every member with a real-time, unchangeable, and fully transparent view of the group's finances and performance.

**Effortless Automation**: Our platform provides access to automated DeFi strategies, allowing your group to optimize and grow your funds with minimal effort and maximum security.

**Empowering the Next Generation**: We're making saving and investing accessible to young adults who may have felt excluded from traditional finance due to a lack of knowledge or capital.

## Built on Lisk
CheMango DEFI is being built within the Lisk ecosystem, leveraging its robust framework to create a scalable and secure decentralized application. We are focused on the DeFi vertical, specifically in the areas of stablecoins, lending and borrowing protocols, and oracles.

## Get Involved!
We are currently in the bootstrapping phase and working to develop our Minimum Viable Product (MVP). We're passionate about bringing financial empowerment to the world through a trust-based, decentralized model.
